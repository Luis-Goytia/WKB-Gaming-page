            An esport event is not organised at the last minute or without a
            goal. As with any project, it is essential to plan ahead and clearly
            define the reasons and objectives for which you are organising it.

            <p>
              The choice of the ideal date is crucial. You can increase
              participation and ensure that your event has an impact by checking
              that it does not coincide with other sporting events or other
              events, especially in your area. Remember to choose a date far
              enough away to organise and announce the event.

              We need to consider the necessary resources and costs. The city
              council can lend you equipment and offer some help and finance,
              but more is required. Of course, you can look for sponsors to
              support you and make your event financially viable. Offer them
              something attractive, which gives them visibility to their
              audience and boosts their brand image. There will be companies in
              the area willing to offer you financing in return. Do not hesitate
              to contact these companies and present them with an exciting
              sponsorship dossier.

          <div className={Styles.text7}>
            <p>
              One of the critical elements of the organisation of an esport
              event is the management of registrations for participants and
              their teams and ticket sales to spectators. Everything will be
              much easier with an online ticketing and registration system. With
              this platform, you can conveniently collect data and manage
              payments.

          </div>
          <div className={Styles.text7}>
            <p>
              Managing payments for food, drink and merchandising during the
              esport event can be challenging, especially for big events. Esport
              venues can use a cashless payment system that allows customers to
              buy drinks inside the stadium using a pre-loaded card, thus
              avoiding queues, especially at half-time.

          </div>
          <div className={Styles.text7}>
            <p>
              Without spectators and gamers, an esport event doesn’t exist.
              Therefore, the communication of the event is crucial. You can
              communicate in both general and specialised press. Social media
              (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter) can also be used to
              inform before and during the event (stages, follow-up, winners…).
              After your sporting event, don’t hesitate to ask for feedback and
              comments. Knowing what you can improve will be helpful if you want
              to organise a similar event again. Be sure to.
