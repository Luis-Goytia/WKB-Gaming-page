      <h5>Step 1: Know Why Your Club Exists</h5>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.text1}>
      <p>
        The first step to take when making your own club is to gather the
        founding members, clarify the purpose of your club and identify any
        long-term goals you want to achieve.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.subtitle}>
      <h5>Step 2: Structure Your Club & Governance</h5>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.text1}>
      <p>
        The goal of a social club is to gather members for regular or
        semi-regular social activities. This entails very little overhead and
        members can largely self-organize with a loose and minimal structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clubs that require a steady cash flow to operate need a formal
        organizational structure to help organize and manage various moving
        parts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.subtitle}>
      <h5>Step 3: How to Get New Members</h5>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.text1}>
      <p>
        Now that you and your fellow founding members have a shared
        understanding of the club’s mission and objectives, it’s time to start
        growing your membership. But before you can grow your membership, you
        need to understand what people to target for recruitment.

    <div className={Styles.subtitle}>
      <h5>Step 4: Outline the Financial Structure</h5>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.text1}>
      <p>
        Developing and maintaining effective financial records is the key to
        success for any club or organization. As your membership grows,
        financial record-keeping will become increasingly important.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.subtitle}>
      <h5>Step 6: Hold Your First Club Meeting</h5>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.text1}>
      <p>
        Once your club website is ready to go and you’ve started recruitment,
        it’s time to host your first meeting!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.subtitle}>
      <h5>Step 7: Attract & Engage Your Members</h5>
    </div>
    <div className={Styles.text1}>
      <p>
        However, it’s not time to rest on your laurels just yet. There are a
        number of other things you’ll need to set up going forward in order to
        effectively engage with your club members.
