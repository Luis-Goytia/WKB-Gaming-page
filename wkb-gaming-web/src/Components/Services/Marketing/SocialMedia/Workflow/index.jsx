          Effective social strategy begins with understanding your business’s
          goals and objectives, as well as your current audience and target
          customer. We work alongside business owners and in-house social media
          managers to understand the core of your business and develop a renewed
          playbook. The copywriters and community managers working on your
          account will meet with you to understand the voice of your brand, so
          that social content can be generated from your unique brand
          perspective.

          After a competitor analysis and social media audit, we produce a

          from these categories based on your goals. Our industry-specific
          research informs strategic decisions on which social media platforms
          your business should focus on.
