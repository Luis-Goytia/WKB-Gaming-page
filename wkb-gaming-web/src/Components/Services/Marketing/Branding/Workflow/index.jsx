          Of course, it’s not a designer who sets the goals of a company or
          defines its personality still it is a foundation of all the branding
          process. To receive the expected results, the company has to set the
          priorities and values at the start point so that the crew working on
          branding could see which way to go. They do not necessarily need to be
          defined and used for all the cycle of brand existence. The goals can
          be modified later during a creative process but it’s vital to have
          some directives in the beginning.

      </div>
      <div className={Styles.text1}>
        <p>
          When the goals are set and a company’s personality seems clear,
          designers go to the research work. This step is essential for all
          kinds of designer’s job, be it a logo or a mobile app. The research
          helps to immerse into the environment of the future brand and
          comprehend the peculiarities which may influence its success.

        <p>
          First goes the market research. Designers dig out the information
          about the market and potential competitors. It’s good to learn from
          someone’s experience be it good or bad. Having the necessary data
          experts can create a unique and efficient logo and build a brand
          identity that will stand out the competition.

        <h5>3. Logo design</h5>

      <div className={Styles.text1}>
        <p>
          It is the basic mark of brand identity, the most prominent symbol of
          brand image and the foundation of effective marketing strategy
          enabling its connection with the target audience.
          <br />
          One of the aspects the research includes is exploring logos of the
          competitive companies. It helps to avoid unnecessary similarity with
          other logos in the sector and make an original brand identity.
          <br />
          When all the core information is gathered, designers move to more
          artistic stage — creative process itself. By the means of various
          experiments, they choose the style direction and color palette which
          will work best for a brand.

      <div className={Styles.text1}>
        <p>
          Logo design is not the only visual representation of a brand.
          Certainly, the major focus will always be a logo but there are some
          more elements deserving the attention such as mascots and typography.
          <br />
          Companies often look for the ways of personalizing a brand and we have
          a solution. Mascots are the custom design characters created to
          represent the brand in a quite symbolic way. They can be created as a
          part of a logo or exist as an individual brand element. Such
          characters can establish the connection with users as nothing else.

        <h5>5. Corporate brand style</h5>

      <div className={Styles.text1}>
        <p>
          When the logo is ready, the color palette is chosen, and other visual
          elements are prepared, it’s time to unite them into harmonic corporate
          style. It is required when a designer works on branding for companies
          providing services. Various attributes can become a branded item
          depending on a type of a company. There are some common brand items
          which are used by different companies:
          <br />
          Business card, correspondence, envelope design for Reborn, billboards
          and banners, posters, vehicle branding, branded clothes, etc.

        <h5>6. A style guide</h5>
      </div>
      <div className={Styles.text1}>
        <p>
          The work is done. The visual material is complete. The last task for
          the designer is to make sure clients will use all the assets properly.
          A style guide is a document providing instructions about correct and
          wrong ways to use the graphics created for the brand. Traditionally, a
          style guide includes the explanation of the idea standing behind a
          logo as well as the presentation of a corporate color palette which
          can be used for different purposes. It can be good to demonstrate the
          examples of incorrect usage in order to avoid poor visual performance.
