          The goal of discovery is to identify the needs of users through valid
          research and set realistic project goals for the strategic roadmap.

          Depending on needs, the project goals might range from building a
          reasonable minimum viable product to building out a full multi-faceted
          mobile platform solution.

          <p>
            Prototyping is the stage where you start rapidly producing
            wireframes and iterating on user feedback. A wireframe can be
            thought of as a low-fidelity guide to the UI and UX of your app and
            offers a general sense of the app's functionality and flow without
            getting into the smaller details of colour or style

        <div>
          <p>
            User experience design is, probably, the most exciting part of the
            mobile application development lifecycle because it gives you the
            first glimpse of how your application can look and work. At this
            step, we determine how users will experience the application and
            interact with the system.

          <p>
            Agile development methodology is an industry-standard and
            time-proven approach in software development. Before we start
            coding, we break down the whole development process into a series of
            cycles, each of which includes development, testing and review. In
            every cycle, we develop a batch of features, test the
            implementation, fix issues, and make a review.

          <h5>5 – Testing and launch</h5>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            There are functional and performance tests that help ensure
            everything works as it should, the app is fast and can handle the
            load.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            For a consumer-focused application, you may need to have a web
            landing that promotes the application and provides links to the
            stores where the app is published.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            After all the key stages of mobile developing, an app goes to
            stores, and you get first reviews and installation statistics. It
            may seem that your journey is over, but in most cases, it is not.
