          <p>
            Websites are designed using any of several different types of
            layouts, including linear, hierarchical, and Webbed. Each layout
            links, or connects, the Web pages in a different structure to define
            how users navigate through the site and view the Web pages. You
            should select a layout for your Web site based on how users will
            most easily navigate through the site to complete tasks and view the
            Web site contents.

        </div>

          <p>
            A linear Web site layout connects Web pages in a straight line. A
            linear Web site layout connects Web pages in a straight line. A
            linear Web is appropriate if the information on the Web pages should
            be read in a specific order.
          </p>
        </div>

        <br />
        <div className={Styles.text8}>
          <p>
            A hierarchical Web site layout connects Web pages in a tree-like
            structure. A hierarchical Web site layout works well on a site with
            a main index or table of contents page that links to all other Web
            pages. With this layout, the main index page would display general
            information and secondary pages include information that is more
            detailed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={Styles.text7}> 
          <p>
            A Webbed Web site layout has no set structure. A Webbed Web site
            layout works best on Web sites with information that does not need
            to be read in a specific order and with many navigation options that
            users can select.

        <div className={Styles.text8}>
          <p>
            Most Web sites are a combination of the linear, hierarchical and
            Webbed layouts. Some of information on the Web site might be
            organized hierarchically from an index page; other information might
            be accessible from all areas of the site while other information
            might be organized linearly to be read in a specific order.

        </div>
        <div className={Styles.text3}>
          <p>
            Using a combination of the three layouts is appropriate, if it helps
            users navigate through the site easily.

            A Web site should be tested at various stages of the Web design and

          <p>
            Once the Web site testing is complete and any required changes have
            been made, the Web site can be implemented. Implementation of a Web
            site means publishing the Web site or uploading it into a Web
            server.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={Styles.text1}>
          <p>
            Once, the Web site has been implemented, its maintenance will
            include updating the information content by removing the outdated
            one and putting in the new one.

            Periodical checking of the links is also necessary to ensure that

        <div className={Styles.text2}>
          <p>
            Finally, Website monitoring is another key aspect of maintenance.
            Usually, the Web servers that host the Web sites keep logs about Web
            site usage.
